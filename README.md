Brief Description of the project#   

End-to-End Data Warehouse for CRM/ERP Integration | SQL, ETL Pipelines, Layered Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold). Transforms raw data into insights using Star Schema. Includes Git, Draw.io workflows, and docs. Ideal for sales analytics, customer segmentation, and product tracking.


Project Outline: End-to-End Data Warehouse Solution
This project demonstrates building a Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL, ETL processes, and layered architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold). Below are the key steps:

1. Project Setup
Understand SQL projects and Data Warehousing fundamentals.
Study ETL processes and gather project materials.
Plan the project using Notion and analyze requirements.
2. Design the Architecture
Design the overall Data Warehouse structure.
Choose methodologies (e.g., Kimball) and define Bronze, Silver, Gold layers.
Visualize the architecture using Draw.io.
3. Initialize the Project
Define naming conventions for tables and schemas.
Set up a Git repository for version control.
Create database schemas and commit initial code.
4. Build the Bronze Layer
Analyze source systems (CRM, ERP).
Write DDL scripts and load raw data into Bronze tables.
Automate data loading with stored procedures.
Document data flow from sources to Bronze.
5. Build the Silver Layer
Explore and clean data from the Bronze layer.
Write DDL scripts and transform data for Silver tables.
Load cleaned datasets (e.g., crm_cust_info, erp_sales).
Automate processes with stored procedures.
Document data flow from Bronze to Silver.
6. Build the Gold Layer
Learn Star Schema modeling and differentiate Dimensions vs. Facts.
Create Dimension tables (Customers, Products) and Fact table (Sales).
Build a Star Schema model for analytics-ready data.
Document metadata and data flow from Silver to Gold.
7. Final Deliverables
Version-controlled SQL scripts and configurations in Git.
Visualized architecture diagrams using Draw.io.
Comprehensive documentation in Notion.
Analytics-ready data for sales, customer, and product insights.
Technologies
SQL, Git, Draw.io, Notion
Use Cases
